Project Overview
In this project, I developed a pirate intelligent agent that navigates a maze using reinforcement learning techniques, specifically deep Q-learning. 
The objective was to train the agent to locate a treasure efficiently while avoiding obstacles. The starter code provided defined the maze environment (TreasureMaze.py) 
and an experience replay object (GameExperience.py). My role involved completing the deep Q-learning implementation in the Jupyter Notebook (TreasureHuntGame.ipynb) 
by integrating neural network models, designing the Q-training algorithm, and optimizing the agent's exploration and exploitation balance.

Connection to the Field of Computer Science
This project demonstrates key concepts in reinforcement learning and neural networks, which are integral in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). 
Computer scientists apply these techniques to develop intelligent systems that can learn from experiences, make predictions, and adapt to changes in dynamic environments. 
This project showcases how these concepts are used to solve complex pathfinding and decision-making problems, which have real-world applications in fields like robotics, 
autonomous driving, and logistics.

Problem-Solving Approach as a Computer Scientist
As a computer scientist, I approach problems by first understanding the requirements and constraints of the task at hand. I break down the problem into smaller,
manageable components, such as defining the environment, designing the learning model, and establishing a training loop. I then iteratively develop and test solutions, 
adjusting parameters and debugging code to ensure optimal performance. This methodical, data-driven approach helps in creating efficient, scalable, and effective solutions.

Ethical Responsibilities
When developing intelligent systems, my ethical responsibilities extend to both the end user and the organization. It is essential to ensure the software is reliable, 
secure, and does not lead to harmful or unintended consequences. For example, AI algorithms should be designed and tested to minimize biases and avoid making discriminatory 
or unsafe decisions. Additionally, transparency and explainability are crucial, as users should be informed about how the system operates and makes decisions. As a developer, 
maintaining the integrity of the data and prioritizing user privacy and safety are fundamental to the trustworthiness of intelligent systems.
