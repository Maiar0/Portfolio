These are some of my DayZ Mods.
I have done hundreds of bug fixes and tweaks to user experience that are not here as I felt it would be an overwhelming amount of rubble to look through. 
Almost every mod in this folder has a configuration for the owner. very few of these mods are locked on they must work different way so that server owners can choose how their server is experienced for the players.
Everything here was written before any formal schooling.
